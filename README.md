# furniture-management-system
The Furniture Management System is designed to provide a centralized platform for efficiently 
managing furniture inventory, sales, and user roles within a furniture store. Many furniture 
businesses currently face challenges with tracking inventory, sales data, and user activities 
manually or through disparate systems, leading to inefficiencies and errors. Our system aims to 
streamline these processes, offering real-time visibility and enhanced operational efficiency
